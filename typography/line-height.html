        <p>"Who are you?" asked the Scarecrow when he had stretched himself and yawned. "And where are you going?"</p>
        <p>"My name is Dorothy," said the girl, "and I am going to the Emerald City, to ask the Great Oz to send me back to Kansas."</p>
        <p>"Where is the Emerald City?" he inquired. "And who is Oz?"</p>
        <p>"Why, don't you know?" she returned, in surprise.</p>
        <p>"No, indeed. I don't know anything. You see, I am stuffed, so I have no brains at all," he answered sadly.</p>  
        <p>"Oh," said Dorothy, "I'm awfully sorry for you."</p>
        <p>"Do you think," he asked, "if I go to the Emerald City with you, that Oz would give me some brains?"</p>
        <p>"I cannot tell," she returned, "but you may come with me, if you like. If Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you are now."</p>
        <p>"That is true," said the Scarecrow.  "You see," he continued confidentially, "I don't mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed, because I cannot get hurt.  If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin into me, it doesn't matter, for I can't feel it. But I do not want people to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw instead of with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?"</p>
        <p>"I understand how you feel," said the little girl, who was truly sorry for him.  "If you will come with me I'll ask Oz to do all he can for you."</p>
        <p>"Thank you," he answered gratefully.</p>
        <p>They walked back to the road. Dorothy helped him over the fence, and they started along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City.</p>
